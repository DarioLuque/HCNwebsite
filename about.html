      <p>Rachel has always been in love with breakfast foods. After being fed up with a variety of health problems, she turned to food for the solution. She learned what did and didn't work for her. Sugar and oil were out, which meant so was granola. Then one day Christopher said, "you can probably make it without." Using her food and nutrition knowledge she did and it was amazing! They decided they couldn't keep it all to themselves and HippieChick Noms was born. Now you can enjoy our love for breakfast (or anytime) granola!</p>
