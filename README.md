## HippieChick Noms Website

### Notes
* This website is a WIP
* I haven't figured out Gulp yet, so I do a lot of things manually. For instance, I the `styles.css` file is where I organize my css 'partials'. Before uploading the new css I use the `cat` command to concatenate all the `.css` files into `style.css` (which is the css file that all the pages draw from)


### To-Do
[ ] Find a better colour for links---preferably based on the monkey's purple vest
[ ] Fix `about` page to *not* create new grid column since there are only 2 grid items
[ ] Fix `contact` page so it has the FB messenger "message us" show up
[ ] Add 'Where to find us' page
[ ] Add 'Recipe' page
[ ] Refactor grid css to not need container div ('container' class goes on `body` element)
